      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Berlin</h1>
      <p>Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population. I recently travelled there and was fascinated by its amazing sights which are steeped with History and Culture.
         Another side of Berlin I thoroughly enjoyed was the amazing and unique night life. Also known as the techno capital of the world there was a huge number of Nightclubs on offer many of which did not close until morning time which is amazing!!
         I would highly recommend Berlin as a must see travel destination for people of all tastes.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Amsterdam</h1>
      <p>As a keen traveller visiting Amsterdam was at the very top of my list and I spent a lovely weekend there last July. Amsterdam has so much to offer it's hard to find a place to start.
         Whether visiting historic and cultural spots like the Anne Frank house or enjoying a tasty beer at the Heineken experience Amsterdam has it all. I would strongly recommend visiting the Vondelpark and relaxing in the Sun.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Zambia</h1>
      <p>When I visited Zambia during the summer 2017 on an Immersion Project with my school it was one of the most amazing
         experiences of my life. The people we encountered were some of the friendliest and most welcoming you will ever meet.
         Between spending some of our time working hard on a local farm, learning the Zambian way of teaching in the local school or seeing Victoria falls, one of the natural wonders of the world,
         we had a very busy trip. I would definitely recommend visiting Zambia at least once in a lifetime.</p>
