      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Hurling</h1>
      <p>Hurling is my favourite sport. I am and have been a member of numerous teams. I play with Glen Rovers and UCC.
         I also played Harty Cup with my secondary school CBC. Last year I won a minor county championship with Glen Rovers.
         I also love watching and going to matches. The game is very fast paced and is spectacular entertainment.</p>

      <p>I play Gaelic Football with St Nicholas GAA club. Football is very physical and also a fast paced game.
      My favourite Gaelic Football player is Aidan O'Shea, he plays inter-county with Mayo. One of favourite memories is attending the 2010 All Ireland
      Football Final in Croke Park the last time Cork won.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Golf</h1>
      <p>Golf is a sport I have been playing my whole life. I am a member of two Golf Clubs.Cork Golf Club and Ceann Sibeal which is located in Dingle Co.Kerry.
      Golf is a game of patience and although sometimes becomes very frustrating it is a fantastic game to play and improve at. It is a game for all ages and the golf community is very welcoming and always provides a great atmosphere either on the course or off.</p>
